### CPSC 120

- Lab 8

  Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because it was a transition from an easy step to a hard one when I actually coded. Lab 8 was about reading from a file and also being able to push back information to write in the file. It was a fun experience when I could write something in the file.

- Lab 10

  Lab 10, part 3 was also my favorite because it was the first lab we worked on with color. It was fun to put everything we'd learned together, such as reading text from the keyboard, opening a file and reading it line by line, and writing text into a file. With the library, combine all of them and make an image.

- Lab 11

  Lab 11, part 2 was my top favorite because I got to learn about classes. Although I did not have a chance to make my own, it was cool to use classes because they made it easy to work with objects. It will be helpful for me when I am working with it in the future, so my code will be optimized.
